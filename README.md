# HonyakuBot
- A game designed to train human beings like an AI. 
- Uses datasets with semantic analysis to judge accuracy.

## Sytem Requirements
- Testing in codespaces, should work on any OS that supports python.
- Does not require any extensive hardware.

## Use
- Terminal app [main.py], run it. Ex: python3 app/main.py
- Commands are in app.
- Will do some installing on first use.

## Notes
- Does not have GUI yet. [ Python html server later ]
- Provided data only has Japanese -> English. [ Will add some more samples later ]
- Does not care about difficulty or manage it for you. [ Future use AI to determine difficulty? ]
- Does not track which sentences are done [ Later use database with SQLite? ]

## Use own TSV
- Replace data jp-eng.tsv with [Language to translate] in the 2nd column, and [Language out] in fourth.
